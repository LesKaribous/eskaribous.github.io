I built my fair share of cool projects and robots, but something was always missing, a cool DIY controller. My first attempt to build a custom controller was this one: https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/29745-My-Teensy-Based-Robot-Controller [https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/29745-My-Teensy-Based-Robot-Controller]. It was based on a Teensy board, had a xbee board, and plenty channels, but it lacked design, good gimbals, and more wireless protocols. So this is my new attempt to make the ultimate RC Transmitter","domain":"hackaday.io"}
