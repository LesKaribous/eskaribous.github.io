{"title":"Gallery | Alpha V1: Open-Source Remote Controller","url":"https://hackaday.io/project/164523-alpha-v1-open-source-remote-controller","image":"https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6920361553325998902.jpg","description":"Alpha V1 is the result of years of struggle with making custom made remote controllers for various robots. Finally, we decided that enough is enough. Alpha V1 is one remote controller that can be easily customized and modified to be used with all sort of robots and drones.The front and back plates are laser cut out of 4mm acrylic plates, so not only can you laser cut new ones, but also you can drill and cut the plates to add new switches, joysticks and etc.On the firmware side, we have developed many libraries to make sure hardware customization would not require you to write a single line of code, instead you just need to activate them through the menus. If you needed a feature that we have not implemented, Alpha V1 is open-source and you will have full access to development resources to go further.We are planning to crowdfund Alpha V1, so signup in our website to get notified at launch or follow our social media pages for more pictures and updates.","domain":"hackaday.io"}
