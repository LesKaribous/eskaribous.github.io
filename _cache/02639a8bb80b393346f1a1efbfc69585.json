I always disliked that the FPV control of PAN/TILT systems used additional channels of my primary rc tx.\nSo I decided to build and integrated system that works independently from the RC and/or UAV setup. It should have and own receiver for controlling at least 2 cameras, a video downlink and a OSD controller for telemetry data. The ground unit had to be compact like a RC TX.\nActually I finished the system and I can control 2 cameras. One is a classic pan/tilt front camera with a GO Pro HD Hero live feed that can be moved by the head-tracker or by joystick. The second camera is a ripped CCTV with 30x optical zoom as belly/dome camera. I’m actually working on the stabilization of that one. I test the system with an old RC car using as receiver the remote unit itself.\nThe result is following:\nGround station/unit:\n\n\n5.8Ghz Video receiver\n8 ch 2.4Ghz Corona RC TX DIY Module\nEagle Tree Diversity ground…","domain":"diydrones.com"}
